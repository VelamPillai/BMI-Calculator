This was a 3 days project built during SPA module at DCI web development boot camp . Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an web application that allowed users to enter their height and weight ,then the application will calculate BMI and display the BMI value and its category, I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate,then created individual components ,finally used styled components to give nice appearance for the Application.


The technologies implemented in this project are React, VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup time. In the next version I plan on to implement responsive version of the app.
